# PortSentencer
This repository has the `portSent.py` program, a sentencer for Portuguese text.

This program receives as input one or more textual files with text in Portuguese and generates a single textual file where each sentence is saved in a different line.

## Sentencing Example
For example, if the following text is given as input:

`A rua Dr. Flores é uma rua da cidade de Porto`

`Alegre? Provavelmente, 90% dos gaúchos vai`

`dizer-nos que sim. Até os que não moram`

`nos bairros de Porto Alegre.`

The output will be split in three sentences:

`A rua Dr. Flores é uma rua da cidade de Porto Alegre?`

`Provavelmente, 90% dos gaúchos vai dizer-nos que sim.`

`Até os que não moram nos bairros de Porto Alegre.`

To do so, this program needs a list of known abbreviations in Portuguese that is read from the file `abbrev.txt`.

Another option available in this program is to provide a limit for the number of characters in each sentence.

## Usage example
`python3 portSent.py -o sents.txt -r -l 2048 text1.txt text2.txt`

This command fetch the input from files `text1.txt` and `text2.txt`, it performs the substitution of non standard characters (`-r`) and sets a limit of 2048 characters per sentence (`-l 2048`), saving the produced sentences in the file `sents.txt` (`-o sents.txt`).
