# PortSentencer
This repository has the portSent.py program, a sentencer for Portuguese text.

This program receives as input one or more textual files with text in Portuguese and generates a single textual file where each sentence is saved in a different line. For example, if the following text is given as input:

`A rua Dr. Flores é uma rua de Porto Alegre? Quase todo gaúcho vai dizer que sim.`

The output will be split in two sentences:

`A rua Dr. Flores é uma rua de Porto Alegre?`
`Quase todo gaúcho vai dizer que sim.`

To do so, this program needs a list of known abbreviations in Portuguese that is read from the file `abbrev.txt`.

This program also performs, optionally, replcing of unusual characters, as non standard quotation marks and dashes, by the traditional characters available in both ASCII and UTF-8.

Another option available in this program is to provide a limit for the number of characters in each sentence.

## Usage example
`portSent -o sents.txt -r -l 2048 text1.txt text2.txt`

This command fetch the input from files `text1.txt` and `text2.txt`, it performs the substitution of non standard characters (`r`) and sets a limit of 2048 characters per sentence (`-l 2048`), saving the produced sentences in the file `sents.txt`.
